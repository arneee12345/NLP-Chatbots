You’re eager to learn new things, cross paths with fresh faces and check out what’s happening in your ‘hood.

You might meet kindred spirits in the process and start hanging out together at nearby haunts.

Do you have a spiritual practice in place for times like today, Sag? The Scorpio new moon in your twelfth house of retreat and relaxation is prompting you to step back from the world and soothe your soul—not just now, but on a regular basis. Whether you start meditating every morning, attending a weekly sound bath or tracking your dreams, the point is to honor your inner life going forward. As an antidote to burnout, leave whitespace in your calendar for recharging your battery.

Pisces Monthly Horoscope
WEEK OF November 17 - 23, 2025
Going somewhere, Pisces? The wanderlust may feel irresistible now, but because Mercury, the planet of communication and transportation, is retrograde until November 29, warnings about proceeding with extreme caution are warranted. The tiny messenger planet has been off course since November 9 in Sagittarius and your career zone. But on Tuesday, November 18, it backflips into Scorpio and your ninth house of travel and adventure, pulling your thoughts toward exotic locales. Contrary to popular lore, you CAN plan—and even take—a trip during this cycle. But for your own peace of mind, go to extra lengths to sniff out any hidden costs or misleading information. Take nothing for granted, and make sure all the confirmations land in your DMs. While you’re at it, back up important files, follow up on calls and emails promptly and build in extra time around flights or check-ins in case there are unforeseen delays (like canceled flights or local transit strikes). If you’re not already halfway out the door, you can make good use of this forced retrograde slowdown by doing all those “re” actions: retreating, researching and reviewing all your plans before putting them out into the world. It’s also a great time to revisit a meaningful location or to revive a personal project you put on hold, like that podcast or business plan for your dream venture.

Thursday’s new moon in Scorpio turns up the heat even higher in your ninth house of expansion, higher learning and distant horizons. Opportunities that align with your true calling might require a bit more travel than you initially expected, Pisces. Feed your wanderlust by researching destinations and sketching out preliminary itineraries for your next journey, even if departure is months away. Tight on cash? Get resourceful: Explore home exchanges, house-sitting gigs or splitting accommodation costs with friends. The ninth house also governs entrepreneurship, so this six-month lunar cycle supports you in laying the groundwork for a venture where you’re the boss. Already running the own show? Identify a fresh market to penetrate or innovative methods to grow your brand. Is there a book manuscript or podcast concept brewing in your imagination that’s ready to emerge? Register for a workshop to build momentum. Education receives cosmic support right now, so if you recognize gaps in your expertise or credentials, enroll in relevant coursework. If that program happens to be located in a charming seaside village, well, that’s a sacrifice you’ll simply have to make. Already an expert in your domain? This new moon could spark inspiration to develop a curriculum or facilitate a retreat.

On Friday, the Sun zips into Sagittarius, igniting your tenth house of career and public status through December 21. The festive holiday season creates the perfect cover for taking clients and colleagues out to deepen your professional relationships. Even if you’d prefer curling up in front of a crackling fire with spiked eggnog or watching your living room walls get their expert paint treatment, bold networking moves can help you seal important deals or negotiate your way into that well-earned project, promotion or something exceeding your grandest ambitions. You can achieve serious career breakthroughs this year while enjoying seasonal celebrations. With Mercury retrograde until November 29, you might even reconnect with a former boss or mentor. Either way, you’ll discover it’s significantly easier to secure quality time with top executives in relaxed holiday settings than trying to schedule formal appointments through their gatekeepers.

Need a do-over? You’re in luck, Water Bearer! On Tuesday, November 18, mental Mercury (retrograde since November 9) backtracks out of Sagittarius and your communal eleventh house into Scorpio and your professional tenth house for the remainder of its reverse commute (until November 29). Mercury retrograde gets a lot of attention for the challenging plot twists it’s associated with, but it also has an upside. As it retreats over ground it just covered in forward motion, YOU have a chance to review and revise your output from that time. For the next eleven days, the analytical messenger planet will be back-pedaling in your career zone, and it will continue activating this area until it returns to Sagittarius on December 11. That’s your cue to head back to the drawing board on anything that missed its mark the first go-round. Just bear in mind it’s still moving backward, so the results of your efforts may not bear fruit for a few more weeks. Retrogrades always offer a chance to turn inward and reflect as well as to review, re-evaluation and redo anything that isn’t 100 percent polished. So during this unpredictable retrograde, make sure everything you say and especially what you put in writing is explicit and adheres to policy—as well as your personal ethics.

Ready for liftoff, Aquarius? Thursday’s annual new moon in Scorpio energizes your ambitious tenth house of career and public recognition. This lunar reset launches a six-month window that could catapult your professional reputation to new heights. The clearer you are about your goals, the more the results will reflect them, so reverse engineer from your ideal outcome. Picture yourself at the Scorpio FULL moon next May 1, 2026: What does your professional life look like then? What role are you playing? What kind of acknowledgment are you receiving? Rather than grinding endlessly and hoping for the best, strategic relationship-building will accelerate your trajectory exponentially. Your sign knows that success lives at the intersection of talent and connections. Your social network can open doors faster than years of solitary effort. Consider investing in power breakfasts with industry leaders or enrolling in that specialized workshop. View these as down payments on your future, not burdens on your schedule and budget.

The Sun charges into Sagittarius on Friday, activating your eleventh house of collaboration, community and innovation through December 21. This is your natural habitat, so you should you’ll feel completely in your element over the next four weeks. Because this chart sector is associated with experimentation and progressive group endeavors, this is an auspicious period for Aquarians. Instead of isolating in your home office for marathon work sessions, give in to the pull toward collaborative projects with brilliant, unconventional thinkers. Trade those solo all-nighters for participation in inventive collectives or quality face time with your crew. You’ll derive far more satisfaction from purposeful community engagement than attempting to micromanage every moving part alone. This team-oriented energy might also unlock genuine pleasure and help you create meaningful connections while honoring your authentic self. Reserve those one-on-one appointments for your birthday season in early 2026.

WEEK OF November 17 - 23, 2025
And you’re back—sort of. On Tuesday, November 18, social Mercury (retrograde) reverses from Sagittarius and your introspective twelfth house into Scorpio and your eleventh house of teamwork and technology, wrapping up its three-week retrograde there (on November 29). Group dynamics might get confusing during this window, so stay alert and make sure everyone’s working off the same playbook. Schedule regular check-ins with your collaborators and confirm that everything’s being properly documented. Work threads can get tangled easily now, so track directives and progress meticulously. Reunions are extra sweet with Mercury in reverse, even if predicting whether they’ll lead anywhere meaningful is tricky. If you’re considering rejoining a former creative collective or booking a getaway with old friends instead of signing up for something new, gather all the relevant information first. Back up all sensitive files with strong passwords and store them someplace secure, like a vault or wallet. Communication and connections can get scrambled since Mercury loves messing with your messaging. On the bright side, you have an excellent window for reviewing situations before you commit. The bonus time and focus you get might reveal something crucial you would have missed in haste.

Thursday’s Scorpio new moon—the only one of the year—activates your “all for one and one for all” zone, governing teams and collective dreams. This lunar reset is perfect if you’re thinking about redistributing responsibilities and recognition. As someone who’s comfortable taking charge and leading the pack, you don’t shy away from claiming your due credit and chasing glory. But think how much simpler (and more satisfying) life might be if you could co-create with a dream team. Stop hoarding every task and accept help from talented, trustworthy people. Open up to your friend group and even your online networks about your goals and what you’re hoping to achieve. You might be blown away by how many people want to team up with you and support your vision. While there’s nothing wrong with broadening your social horizons, don’t feel compelled to recruit people outside your existing circle. (The right people may already be in your orbit.) Just remember to actually check in with them regularly. No need to immediately dive into anything binding. Get the ball rolling this week and enjoy watching relationships evolve organically. By the time the full moon in Scorpio rolls around next May 1, you’ll feel like family with your new circle.

On Friday, the Sun bursts into Sagittarius and your twelfth house of transitions and surrender through December 21. This four-week cycle is ideal for releasing anything that’s been weighing you down. Stop thinking in terms of beating it or winning. The real goal is letting go. Use your birthday as the natural endpoint for taking inventory of your life. What do you want to call in during this next year, and what do you need to clear OUT to make space? Downsizing and decluttering could become priorities. You won’t be driven by your usual competitive streak, so resist pushing yourself relentlessly. Actually, this is an optimal window to slip off for a spa weekend or a pre-holiday trip to a sunny beach resort. Some Capricorns may have unresolved grief or frustration to process. Rather than powering through on your own, assemble a dream team of support—from energy workers and spiritual guides to more traditional medical professionals who specialize in integrative approaches. Mercury is retrograde until November 29, so pay close attention to your inner monologue. Those background thoughts looping in your mind can affect you more than you realize. You might want to start (or revisit) a meditation practice. Tap your creativity for moments of inspired genius. Who knows? You could arrive at the perfect brainstorming breakthrough while you’re supposed to be resting.

A little bit of freedom is in store for you, Sagittarius. Mindful Mercury has been retrograde in your sign since November 9. But this Tuesday, November 18, the messenger planet slips back into Scorpio and your subterranean twelfth house, taking refuge there until November 29. With Mercury in this misty zone of nostalgia, healing and completions, you may be focused on more internal activities than your usual gallivanting. But knowing you, you won’t go full-on hermit. This is a rich time to reconnect with old friends and take inventory of your current roster while still honoring needs for alone time. This deep-diving cycle is all about surrendering and letting go—or preparing to do so once Mercury pivots direct on November 29. Till then, test the waters. See how it feels to bow out of a few social engagements to allow for more unstructured personal time. Do those things you never seem to have time for: reading, yoga, taking long herbal soaks—and catching up on your sleep. Your mind could drift to places you haven’t explored in years, making this an ideal moment to begin or deepen a contemplative routine. Carving out even a few minutes each morning to meditate, journal or stretch can send you into your day refreshed and grounded before the chaos kicks in. This is a powerful window for working with a therapist, energy healer or spiritual guide to dismantle old patterns that have been running your life on autopilot. Since retrogrades excavate the past and this one lands in your house of endings and release, you might need to revisit something painful before you can truly heal it and clear space for what’s coming next.

Thursday features the only Scorpio new moon of the year, landing in your ethereal twelfth house and offering a rare chance to wipe at least one slate clean. Put pragmatic concerns aside for now, and if you have specific aspirations for the months ahead, write them out and sit with them quietly. Are you ready to elevate your living space, dedicate yourself to a creative pursuit or commit to a serious wellness protocol? Intentions you set this weekend have the potential to manifest into something extraordinary by the Scorpio full moon on May 1, 2026. The twelfth house rules letting go, forgiveness and spiritual completion, so release whatever no longer serves your highest good. You don’t necessarily need to break up with anyone, but you CAN let go of old grudges and tired narratives. Try adopting “live and let live” as your new philosophy. This gentle shift can unlock possibilities far beyond anything you’ve been able to imagine.

Self-assertion becomes easier this Friday as the radiant Sun charges into your bold first house and ignites the Sagittarius fire. Your independent streak roars back to life. You’re feeling lighter, liberated and primed to pursue exciting new directions. The coming four weeks empower you to breathe life into ideas that have been waiting on the sidelines. Fending off energy vampires? Your role now is helping them level up to match your frequency. You could even collaborate with a powerhouse or industry leader who can amplify your vision into something remarkable. Buckle up because your projects are about to accelerate at warp speed. Financial backers might emerge, or sophisticated concepts you’ve been nurturing could suddenly come under your control, at least when the timing is right. Just ensure all your details are ironclad since Mercury will be retrograde until November 29. Establish a strong support network during this period—whether that means hiring a lawyer to examine agreements or bringing on advisers and mentors who can prevent you from stumbling into a terrible deal.

WEEK OF November 17 - 23, 2025
Spotlight on YOU! Mercury retrograde backflips from Sagittarius and your bean-counting second house into your sign and self-empowered first house, not straightening out until November 29. Meaning: You still need to stay on your toes to prevent miscommunications and tech glitches. But there is an upside to this transit. The introspective cycle is great for reviewing your appearance, overall style and public image. Do people understand who you are and what you bring to the table? This is prime time to examine how you present yourself and explore every facet of your personal brand. Mine your “archives” for golden nuggets of inspiration and brilliant concepts you never fully developed. Go back through old notebooks, abandoned projects and half-finished concepts to see what if anything deserves another look. Your brightest breakthrough might be hiding in something you started years ago and forgot about. But don’t rush to implement anything yet—you have until late November to polish your ideas and choose the winners.

Toast to new beginnings this Thursday! The new moon in Scorpio—the only one of 2025—launches your personal New Year celebration. This couldn’t be a better moment for clarifying your top goals and desires and charting a path toward everything you want to achieve by next May 1’s Scorpio FULL moon. The atmospheric energy is electric right now, so carve out a chunk of uninterrupted alone time to focus on this essential work. Capture your dreams on paper or assemble a collage using images that speak to your soul. Don’t analyze or edit yourself—that will only interrupt the flow. Your intuition knows exactly what belongs on that board, and your unconscious will guide you toward authentic expression. Display your creation somewhere you’ll see it daily. Think of this as planting seeds rather than forcing blooms. To the degree you’re able, avoid locking yourself into rigid commitments for the next two weeks. If anything, let this moment kick off a new exploratory phase. Release your grip on timelines and spreadsheets (temporarily) as you plant the seeds to manifest your dreams.

Scorpio season wraps up this Friday as the Sun shifts into Sagittarius and your second house of money, assets and self-worth through December 21. You might feel nostalgic for all the intensity and celebrations (of YOU!), but this solar transit brings its own gifts. The next four weeks present a golden window for transforming your brilliant ideas into concrete reality. Channel your inner project manager and develop actual blueprints. Calculate costs, sketch timelines and determine what support you’ll need to make your vision happen. Once you’ve drafted a solid plan, you can gain serious momentum moving everything forward. Remember to balance ambition with pleasure, though. Let the month unfold with equal parts strategy and sensory delight. Stop to appreciate beauty wherever you encounter it: fresh flowers, quality fabrics, an exquisitely prepared meal. Give yourself permission to invest in a few elevated pieces that will last, rather than disposable trendy items. Quality over quantity makes all the difference.

WEEK OF November 17 - 23, 2025
Don’t count on everything unfolding exactly when you want it to over the next week and a half. On Tuesday, November 18, messenger Mercury backflips from Sagittarius and your hardworking sixth house (where it’s been retrograde since November 9) into Scorpio and your playful fifth house, staying there until November 29. You’ve been absorbing valuable lessons about patience and restraint, so dealing with communication breakdowns, misunderstandings and tech problems might feel extra aggravating right now. Your smartest approach until late November? Zero in on what you can actually influence. Perhaps a creative endeavor requires your attention, or you need to revisit earlier work and make essential updates. Confirm every plan and reservation both verbally and in writing to prevent confusion. The upside of retrograde periods is that they tend to reconnect you with people from earlier chapters of your life, so an old friend might suddenly reach out, or an ex could slide back into your DMs. Just keep your sentimental Cancer heart in check and make sure nostalgia isn’t clouding your judgment about someone who isn’t actually good for you anymore.

Whether fame has ever been part of your vision or not, every Cancer values being seen and appreciated for their abilities. Friday’s new moon in Scorpio—the only one of the year—energizes your fifth house of passion, creativity and romance. Harnessing this powerful moment requires some intention, even if it’s just a general sense of where you want to be by the Scorpio FULL moon next May 1, 2026. This lunar reset boosts your visibility and financial potential. You might need to invest in your own development right now, perhaps by taking a specialized course, upgrading your digital presence or getting professional photos taken. Because the fifth house rewards bold moves, you could see major wins from a calculated risk or a new romantic connection—assuming you’re willing to take action and put yourself forward. Money and love get interestingly tangled during the weeks ahead, so establish clear boundaries early to protect your equilibrium and avoid situations where walking away would serve you better. This adventurous new moon is pushing you toward more joy and celebration. From elegant dinners to concerts and cultural events, seize every opportunity to showcase your winter aesthetic.

Temptation surrounds you throughout the holiday season, so strengthen your resolve to make healthier decisions starting Friday, when the vitalizing Sun enters Sagittarius and illuminates your wellness zone. Even if this annual solar cycle feels familiar, treat it like the blessing it actually is. Let responsible indulgence become your philosophy from now through December 21. We’re not suggesting that you skip holiday festivities or deprive yourself of seasonal pleasures. Waking up feeling terrible every morning, though? That’s genuinely miserable. Eating at consistent times helps regulate your blood sugar, and staying physically active keeps you warm and energized. Get consistent about taking your daily vitamins and make sure you’re eating ample protein. While you’re at it, why not explore a different fitness approach before the year ends? Your workload is going to surge considerably, so get ready to manage competing priorities and distribute tasks to others. When you start feeling overwhelmed, resist the urge to just push through. That’s your cue to find qualified support and delegate portions of your responsibilities. True, bringing in help requires financial investment, Cancer, but the bandwidth you free up lets you concentrate on the work that actually matters most.

WEEK OF November 17 - 23, 2025
End-of-year financial review time! It might strike you as ironic that just as you’re ready to blast ahead with new initiatives, messenger Mercury (who’s been retrograde in Sagittarius and your social third house since November 9) backtracks into Scorpio and your security zone on Tuesday, November 18 (until November 29). This is a clear message from the universe to tap the brakes and do a serious evaluation of your findings. Brace yourself: Examining your finances under a microscope might reveal some unpleasant surprises. Overlooked expenses or calculation errors could surface unexpectedly. Stay focused by treating this slowdown as a gift. Dig into the details, audit everything and get your systems in order. While everyone else races forward, you’ll be refining and perfecting. Someone from your past might reach out with a mind toward reconnection during this window—perhaps a former colleague from years ago or someone you’ve been thinking about lately. If you’re toying with the idea of reviving an old romance or work connection, tread carefully and don’t let nostalgia cloud your judgment.

Thursday’s Scorpio new moon lands in your second house of income and resources, offering a genuine chance to reset your relationship with money. Struggling with debt? You can map out a practical strategy to improve your cash flow situation. Resist the urge to splurge on haute items right now, Libra. But relax: Tightening things up temporarily doesn’t mean permanent deprivation. Dedicate a few hours to poring over every bank account and credit card statement. You’re not committing to endless restriction, just resetting your baseline. Since budgets have two sides (income and expenses), you’ll want to focus on the earning side extensively over the coming month. Refresh your professional materials and alert your network that you’re open to opportunities. Consult financially savvy people in your circle for guidance on building wealth or developing a supplementary income stream. Whether you pursue it consistently or just when the coffers get low is entirely up to you.

On Friday, the brilliant Sun blazes into Sagittarius and your communicative third house, encouraging you to spread your wings socially and reconnect with your community. You have conversations to spark and connections to forge, but watch the clock so you don’t neglect your core group. Your inner circle wants face time with you, too. Your immediate environment comes alive between now and December 21, so scan local calendars for interesting happenings. Try some spontaneous exploration by seeking out popup experiences, gallery openings, seasonal markets and dining spots you haven’t visited yet. You could stumble upon hidden gems and venues that have been there all along AND, as a bonus, meet some intriguing new people in the process. Growing your network could inspire exciting winter adventures as you travel to meet these fresh connections. Dreaming about launching something entrepreneurial in your area or partnering with a local venue for a special occasion? Seize the moment, Libra. This is how beautiful collaborations begin.

You might need to stay vigilant for potential work snafus starting Tuesday, November 18, when mental Mercury (your galactic guardian) backflips out of Sagittarius and your dynamic duos house into Scorpio and your sixth house of health and service, not resuming forward motion until November 29. Brace yourself for Mercury-retrograde delays, misunderstandings, communication breakdowns and tech glitches over the next week and a half. Knowing what’s coming helps you prepare. When frustration builds, don’t reach for comfort food or wine to numb out. Even if they provide temporary relief, tomorrow you’ll wake up with nothing resolved. Better idea? Step away for a five-minute breathing break behind closed doors. Or walk around your neighborhood to clear your mind, zeroing in on what you can actually control rather than fixating on the obstacles. There’s real satisfaction in organizing your spaces and decluttering what no longer serves you. Just don’t get so zealous that you get rid of family treasures you’ll regret losing later. Until Mercury straightens out, leave nothing to chance. Double-check every appointment, review all work with colleagues—and after discussing things verbally—and document everything in writing. A good motto to adopt during Mercury retrogrades: Better safe than sorry.

You don’t have to sample every holiday cookie being passed around, Gemini. Actually, do whatever it takes to avoid the sugar crash because Thursday’s new moon in Scorpio activates your sixth house of vibrant health. Book yourself massages, Pilates sessions and morning meditations. Carve out adequate sleep time and visits to the farmer’s market. Building sustainable habits requires patience, especially during this season of excess, but you absolutely can create healthier holiday routines. The sixth house governs your daily rituals, and this lunar reset will inspire you to work smarter instead of harder. If you’re job hunting, refresh your resume and LinkedIn presence now. Recruiters might reach out, so make sure your network knows about exciting projects you’re developing. This lunar energy helps you organize every aspect of your world and pinpoint how to simplify your days. Since your sign drifts off track easily when distracted, launch a major decluttering project that spans both physical and digital realms. Shred old papers, consign clothes that have been gathering dust for a year, clean out your inbox and remove unused apps cluttering your home screen.

This Friday, the radiant Sun enters Sagittarius—your complementary cosmic vibe—lighting up your world until December 21. This illuminating cycle turns you into a people magnet. Pay attention to how you simultaneously attract and repel others. The ones who stick around through your contradictions are genuine keepers. Sagittarius governs your seventh house of committed partnerships, helping you understand someone’s true role in your world, whether romantic, professional or something else entirely. Sag’s global perspective might also spark a cross-cultural connection or long-distance romance. Mercury stays retrograde until November 29, so someone from your history could resurface, hoping for a second chance. If you think they deserve one, proceed with measured optimism. Verify they’ve genuinely worked on whatever destructive patterns caused your original split. However, if you’ve repeatedly accepted people who fall short of what you need, the Sun is here to remind you that raising your standards is overdue.

Virgo Monthly Horoscope
WEEK OF November 17 - 23, 2025
Platonic relationships could hit a speed bump on Tuesday, November 18, when your ruler, quick-witted Mercury (who’s been retrograding through Sagittarius and your homey fourth house since November 9), retreats into Scorpio and your third house of communication and local friendships. Watch what you say and how you phrase things because even crystal-clear directions can get twisted—or lost in translation. Have people confirm they understood by repeating instructions back to you before launching any collaborative efforts. The messenger planet loves sabotaging even bulletproof strategies. One silver lining of this retrograde? You might dust off a creative project you abandoned or miraculously solve a problem that’s been stumping you forever. Retrogrades also have a knack for bringing exes back around, but stay smart about it—especially if things ended badly last time.

Thursday’s new moon in Scorpio—the only one of the year—activates your chatty third house. No matter how much someone else talks up an event or luxury product, stay skeptical. There’s no reason to rush into a major commitment or purchase right now. Your flexible mutable-sign nature will thank you for keeping your options open instead of boxing yourself in. Were you thinking of buying a car or major appliance? Hold off until Mercury clears its retrograde cycle and gets back into direct motion. Your immediate surroundings are buzzing with potential connections and ventures. Has a local organization or workshop caught your eye? Strike up conversations with business owners in your area—they might trigger brilliant inspiration. (Maybe even a seasonal gathering?) Feeling stuck creatively? Dive into journaling or sketch out ideas for a winter storytelling venture. If you’re craving better systems for managing your tasks and relationships, you could develop something genuinely useful. Whatever you’re crafting that feels authentic and on-brand should be ready to release by the Scorpio full moon next May 1, 2026. You might even find a collaborator whose talents complement yours perfectly.

The Sun moves into Sagittarius and your home zone on Friday, turning your attention to creating a space that nurtures rest, connection and renewal. This cozy, domestically focused solar phase, which is in effect until December 21, awakens your nesting instincts and might put you in early hibernation mode. Somewhere between afternoon naps and batch cooking, you might get inspired to tackle a major home improvement project. If you’ve been endlessly scrolling through interior design feeds, hunting for online appliance deals or considering relocation, start researching neighborhoods—both unfamiliar ones and places from your past—since Mercury will be retrograde until November 29. This is prime time to negotiate a lease or submit an offer if the market conditions make sense. Love where you live? Your place could become everyone’s favorite gathering spot this month. You might host a get-together with longtime friends or nearby family members. At the very least, jump on a group chat and catch up, then watch what plans naturally unfold from there. Who knows? If the right people are interested, you might wind up coordinating a midpoint meetup for New Year’s or organizing a winter beach escape for your squad.

Taurus Monthly Horoscope
WEEK OF November 17 - 23, 2025
On Tuesday, November 18, communicator Mercury (retrograde since November 9) backflips from Sagittarius and your intensity-loving eighth house into Scorpio and your more moderate seventh house of committed partnership, not straightening out until November 29. Luckily, discretion comes naturally to you, Bull, which will work in your favor for the remainder of this three-week reversal. Be intentional about what you share—and WHEN—since timing matters more than usual right now. If a relationship that was flowing smoothly suddenly feels like it’s hitting speed bumps, don’t panic. This temporary slowdown doesn’t mean you need to bail, especially if you channel it productively. Pump the brakes and focus on the “re” activities: Revisit recent conversations, reflect on what you truly want to express, ease up on yourself so you don’t come across as tense, and use this window to reimagine the partnership or the dynamic you’re trying to call in. Retrograde cycles can revive old connections, giving you space to process feelings without the pressure to make anything happen immediately. The universe is offering you a rare chance to get clear on your emotions and do the internal homework that sets you up to either recommit to your relationship or step back into dating with fresh perspective.

Thursday’s skies feature the year’s only new moon in Scorpio, imbuing partnerships with a more serious glow. This lunation reignites your desires and your willingness to go after them, but it also comes with a warning label. Real trust doesn’t form overnight, even when the chemistry feels instant with someone new. Mercury retrograde sharpens your Scorpio-powered lie detector while also turning you into a magnet for receptive people who pick up on all your moody, electrified intensity. People you’d normally let pass by unnoticed might suddenly capture your attention. Your judgment gets supercharged. In an LTR? You might feel ready to take a major leap—whether that’s swapping keys or exchanging rings. Big trust moves require patience and care, so stay committed to building something solid on every level.

On Friday, the energizing Sun blazes into Sagittarius and your intimate eighth house, putting your closest bonds under a magnifying glass until December 21. Do both of you feel fulfilled? Is there simmering tension just under the surface? Over these next four weeks, you may need to address buried issues that keep resurfacing instead of letting them fester. These invigorating solar rays will fire up your libido and could awaken your inner seductress along with kundalini energy, but they might also intensify your need for loyalty. Find ways to activate your sensual side. Start by making beauty a priority. Then get physical, especially if you’ve been living a couch-potato lifestyle lately. Take daily power walks or put on music that inspires you and dance around your space. Reconnecting with your body will feel so incredible that you’ll want to make movement a regular habit. If you’re not sure whether you’re attracted to someone, this honest Sagittarius solar cycle will illuminate the situation. Notice who grabs your attention this month. A mysterious newcomer could end up sharing your bed before winter’s over. Just remember: Mercury stays retrograde until November 29, which might cloud your judgment. This also happens to be a wealth-building cycle. Rather than just grinding away at work, stay alert for ways to generate passive income. You could invest in a start-up, create a product that earns royalties or resell other people’s products online for a significant slice of the earnings.

Leo Monthly Horoscope
WEEK OF November 17 - 23, 2025
Patience, Leo! Not everything will unfold according to your timeline for the next week and a half, and forewarned IS forearmed. On Tuesday, November 18, messenger Mercury, who’s been retrograde in Sagittarius and your playful and flirty fifth house since November 9, backflips into Scorpio and your domestic fourth. That’s a cosmic nudge to manage your expectations and keep your enthusiasm in check until November 29. Consider this a warning to slow down and pay closer attention. Withdraw into your home base, guard your personal sanctuary and resist letting everyone who needs a couch crash at your place. Simmering family tension could erupt over household drama, and the tiniest spark might detonate. Mercury retrograde specializes in baffling miscommunications. Reduce confusion by being ultra-clear in all your exchanges, whether written or spoken. Before any long trip, triple-check your reservations and itinerary. The upside? Retrogrades reconnect you with old friends, colleagues and former lovers who pop up without warning. If someone who hurt you resurfaces, don’t convince yourself things would work out differently this time.

Embrace hibernation mode, Leo. You’ll cherish whatever quiet time you can capture this Thursday, when the annual new moon in Scorpio lights up your fourth house of home and sanctuary. With major planetary action in this zone, focus on elevating your living space. Declutter, reorganize and inject fresh energy into your personal space. Maybe you’ll finally tackle that renovation or invest in furniture that makes everything feel more welcoming. Buying property? Your home foundation needs attention now, whether you’re moving or staying put. This is where you recharge, so get comfortable with your feet up and a cozy blanket wrapped around you. Before knocking down walls or choosing paint colors, clarify exactly what you want from your space. Let this moon illuminate your domestic world and resist pressure to rush major decisions.

Romantic reboot! Your ruler, the energizing Sun, enters fiery Sagittarius on Friday, igniting your passionate fifth house until December 21. This solar power surge becomes a 2025 love life highlight, empowering you to make some bold moves. Sagittarius’ worldly influence might inspire you to book that trip to see the Northern Lights that you’ve fantasized about. Coupled up? Secure a pre-holiday getaway, even just a weekend at a nearby Airbnb. Whatever your status, your magnetism returns with force. Use this energy for celebration and self-expression, letting your fashionista emerge. Move statement pieces to the front of your closet. With your fame zone activated, your superstar self is ready to shine. A dramatic hair transformation could revolutionize your look, but wait until Mercury retrograde ends on November 29 to avoid regrets. Heed Mercury-retrograde travel alerts, too—don’t schedule tight connections or reserve sketchy accommodations.

Aries Astrological Profile
WEEK OF November 17 - 23, 2025
Relationships might shift into hurry-up-and-wait mode starting on Tuesday, November 18, when quicksilver Mercury (retrograde since November 9) slips out of Sagittarius and your expansive ninth house and into Scorpio and your intense eighth house. This backspin lasts through November 29, so even if you’re itching to fast-forward past the “getting to know you” phase, the cosmos has other plans. Strategic pacing matters now—especially when it comes to shared resources, intimate investments and whatever you’re holding close to the vest. While Mercury rewinds through this secretive zone, you could find yourself captivated by someone or something enigmatic, like a new romantic interest shrouded in mystery or perhaps a financial matter that requires further investigation. Some of these opportunities could deliver genuine rewards and emotional satisfaction while others may not pan out. Knowing that, give yourself permission to explore without locking anything down just yet.

If your momentum has stalled lately, hold steady until Thursday, when the year’s only new moon in Scorpio supercharges your eighth house AND your seductive powers. With all this potent energy swirling around, grab hold of anything that feels slightly stale or past its expiration date and breathe new life into it. This transit is all about transformation, so adopt a selective policy: Leave the energy vampires and fair-weather friends behind and spend time only with people who make you feel magnetic, confident and genuinely seen. Beauty and self-worth are intrinsically connected now, so if you’ve been tempted to switch up your aesthetic, ignite your passion or reclaim your confidence in the bedroom, this lunation practically dares you to fan those flames. Make a vision board if it helps you articulate your deepest desires, then watch as the universe starts conspiring to deliver.

Brace yourself for major horizons-widening when the vitalizing Sun moves into adventurous Sagittarius and your worldly ninth house on Friday. Between now and December 21, you could feel inspired to book a life-altering journey, explore entrepreneurial ventures or expand your knowledge base through education. Maybe you’ll finally enroll in that class, workshop or certification program you’ve been eyeing. You might even squeeze in recording a video to share what you know—or simply make more time to gather with family and friends. The Sun will inject you with conviction and enthusiasm for the path ahead, so if you’ve been contemplating launching a podcast, recording content or going live online, this is your moment. Just watch your delivery: The ninth house governs candor, and some people struggle with unfiltered honesty. That intensity doubles while Mercury is retrograde through November 29. Discover ways to smooth the sharper edges and let your message land with both truth and tact.
