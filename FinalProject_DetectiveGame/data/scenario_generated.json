    "title": "Tranquil Betrayal at Harmony Haven",
    "intro_text": "Harmony Haven, a renowned animal sanctuary nestled deep in the Redwood National Park, is a peaceful haven for endangered species and a beacon of conservation. Or so it seemed. The sanctuary's eccentric and wealthy founder, Dr. Aris Thorne, has been found dead in his private study. An empty tranquilizer dart gun, usually locked in the veterinary clinic, lay beside his lifeless body. Preliminary reports suggest anaphylactic shock from an overdose of a powerful animal sedative. The sanctuary is now on lockdown, and it's up to you to uncover the truth behind Dr. Thorne's untimely demise. Who among the devoted staff could commit such a heinous act in a place dedicated to life?",
    "solution": {
      "killer": "Elara Vance",
      "motive": "Elara Vance, the Head Veterinarian, murdered Dr. Thorne to prevent him from selling Harmony Haven to a pharmaceutical corporation, which would convert it into an animal testing facility. She saw this as a profound betrayal of the sanctuary's mission and her life's work. Her rage was further fueled by Thorne's recent firing of her beloved mentor. She confronted him and, in a fit of passion, used a potent animal tranquilizer to end his plans and his life."
    }
  },
  "outcomes": {
    "success": "You've successfully identified Elara Vance as the killer and exposed her desperate act to save Harmony Haven from its founder's betrayal. Justice is served, and the sanctuary's future, while uncertain, is now in better hands.",
    "failure": "Your accusation was incorrect. The true killer remains free, and Harmony Haven may never recover from the injustice. The sanctuary's future is bleak, and Dr. Thorne's killer walks among the innocent.",
    "timeout": "Time has run out, and the killer has evaded justice. The truth behind Dr. Thorne's death is lost to the shadows, and Harmony Haven's legacy is forever stained by this unsolved mystery."
