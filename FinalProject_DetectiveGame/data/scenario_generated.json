Eleanor Vance, the shelter's formidable and wealthy owner, was found dead in her private office, an ornate, heavy ceremonial dog leash discarded nearby. The sanctuary, usually a place of solace, now hums with unspoken tension. Detectives have cordoned off the scene, and three individuals who were present in the building last night are the primary focus of the investigation. The clock is ticking to uncover the truth behind Eleanor's demise before more secrets are buried.",
