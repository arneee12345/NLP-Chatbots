    "intro_text": "Lord Theron Volkov, celebrated astro-archaeologist and a prominent passenger, was found dead in his luxury suite on the interstellar cruise liner 'The Celestial Empress.' The ship is locked down, and the captain has tasked you, a renowned space detective, to find the killer before the next jump to warp. Medical scans indicate a fast-acting neurotoxin, 'Nyx's Kiss,' was administered sometime between 21:30 and 22:30.",
    "solution": {
      "killer": "Dr. Aris Thorne",
      "motive": "Revenge for Lord Volkov stealing Thorne's groundbreaking research on the 'Chrysalis Nebula Artifacts' years ago, leading to Thorne's professional ruin and public humiliation. Volkov was preparing to publish a new paper based on Thorne's stolen work."
    }
  },
  "outcomes": {
    "success": "You have successfully unmasked the killer! Justice is served aboard the Celestial Empress. Dr. Thorne confessed to administering 'Nyx's Kiss' in Lord Volkov's evening nutrient paste, citing years of stolen work and professional sabotage.",
    "failure": "Your accusation was incorrect. The true killer remains at large, and the Celestial Empress is thrown into further chaos. The reputation of the Interstellar Detective Agency is tarnished.",
    "timeout": "The Celestial Empress makes its next warp jump, and crucial evidence is lost in the void. The killer escapes into the vastness of space, leaving the mystery unsolved."
